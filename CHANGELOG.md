# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.6.2] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **Repetition Distribution Logic**: Corrected repetition calculation to match user expectations
  - Fixed logic so requesting 10,000 IPs generates exactly 10,000 unique IPs with repetition applied
  - Total file lines now exceed the requested number based on repetition distribution
  - Example: 10,000 IPs with 97% single use + 3% quad use = 10,000 unique IPs but 10,291 total lines
  - Repetition is distributed randomly throughout the file, not sequentially

### Enhanced
